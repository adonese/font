# Fonts a simple font rendering library in rust

This is just weekend hobby project to utilize llms and to know better how some topics work.

For now, this library successfully renders ABC. C looks a lot like an arrow now but maybe i'll fix that later. we don't output to opentype yet so you will just have to see the embarrasing text on a png file.
